ASSUMPTIONS:
- Compounding frequency: Annually
- Biweekly payments are made for 365 days/year * 2 payments/month = 730 payments in 7 years

RESULT IS APPROXIMATE.

To calculate the monthly payment, we'll first convert the annual interest rate to a decimal and then use the formula:

Monthly Payment = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n - 1]

Where:
- P = Principal loan amount ($35,000)
- i = Monthly interest rate (6.99%/year / 12 months/year = 0.005792)
- n = Number of payments (7 years * 12 months/year = 84 months)

Monthly Payment ≈ $523.91

Since you asked for biweekly payment, we'll divide the monthly payment by 2:

Biweekly Payment ≈ $261.96
